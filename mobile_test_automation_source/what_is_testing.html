        ### New Way of Testing
        <small>
        > We need to stop building organizations where one team writes code and another team tests it. Testing needs to happen all of the time, and at the same time as development. For this to happen, we need to get testers out of their test teams, and fully integrated into software teams.

        ...

        > The great testers of today will be great test specialists on software teams tomorrow. It doesn't matter if they code or not, as long as they provide value and contribute.

        > You write code. And you test.

        ...

        > You write code that helps the product get out the door sooner. And if the code you write (or the testing you do) doesn't help the product, why are you doing it in the first place?

        ### When to do Testing
        <small>
        > Testing can't be something that happens after programming is complete any longer. Testers aren't "breakers" any more - but experts in the testing activity are (or need to be) as critical to making software as anyone else on the team.
